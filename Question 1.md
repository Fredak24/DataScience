Part 1 – Objectives In this part, we start by looking at Jasmine’s problem and create a framework we will later use to solve the problem. (5 points each for a total of 50 points) 
1. Fundamentally, what decisions will Jasmine need to make? 


Jasmin will need to decide how much to invest in LendingClub, and how much money to allocate for other options in the investment.
After deciding how much to invest in LendingClub, she will then need to decide the amount of loan to invest

2. What is Jasmine’s objective when making these decisions? 
Will have to decide on the objective that would help him make as much money as possible. How will she use the data to help her in deciding which loan to invest to see the best return
 
3. How will she be able to distinguish ‘better’ decisions from ‘worse’ ones? 
Jasmin will make a better decision from taking a look at the actual outcome of the loans and finding how much returns she would get from the investment.

4. Why would Jasmine even think past data might be helpful and how could she use past data to help make her decisions? 
Jasmin should look at past data to get into the insights of the loans that are characterized as good. She would use and identify good loans from the following variables;
- Which loans may be paid earlier that the life of the loan
- How soon would the early payment be
- Which loan is likely to default
- How fast would the default happen

5. Take a brief look at the data (you will download it in Part 2) and the data dictionary, paying attention to the description of the attributes that describe the loans. How would you categorize these attributes? 
The attributes of the data will be from the following;
The attributes include things such as employment status, annual income, and employment status, loan interest rates, and total payment, are some of the attributes in the dataset.
Justin will have to know how to handle categorical and numeric variables. For example, Employment Status is categorical variable while FICO is Numerical attribute
   
6.  Which attributes do you think are the most important to an investor like Jasmine? 
   Investors line Jasmine will be most interested in the return on their investments (either actual return or annualized return). Jasmine could calculate the return by using the data available to her. In Jasmine’s case, the relevant variables for calculating the return are the loan status, the total payment, the funded amount, the fees generated, and the loan duration

7. Looking through the data, you might notice some variables seem related. For example, total_pymnt is likely strongly correlated to the loan status. Why are some variables related? 
The total payments is likely to have strongly correlation to all four of the measures mentioned,  (loan default, loan early repayment, and time of aforementioned events). If a loan defaults or is paid back early, total payments on the loan are likely to be lower. Therefore, prediction using these variable for prediction will likely result in a strong model performance
